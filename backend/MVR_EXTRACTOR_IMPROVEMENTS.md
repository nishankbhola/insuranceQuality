# MVR Extractor Improvements - Comprehensive Documentation

## Problem Identified

The original MVR extractor was failing to correctly extract driver names from certain MVR PDF formats. Specifically:

- **MVR_ON_T0168-58306-50618 (1).pdf**: Name was being extracted as "SUNDAY, AUGUST" instead of "TAHMASEBIAN-MALAYERI,NAVID"
- **MVR_ON_K3364-60006-95911 (1).pdf**: Name extraction was also problematic

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:

1. **Overly broad regex patterns** that were matching date information instead of actual driver names
2. **Lack of validation** to detect when extracted data was clearly wrong (like dates in name fields)
3. **No fallback strategies** when primary extraction methods failed
4. **Hard-coded patterns** that didn't account for variations in PDF formats

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Pattern Matching

#### Name Extraction Patterns
```python
name_patterns = [
    # Most specific: Look for "Name:" followed by the actual name
    r'NAME:\s*([A-Z,\-]+(?:\s+[A-Z,\-]+)*)',
    # Alternative: Look in the table format
    r'ON\s+[A-Z0-9\-]+\s+([A-Z,\-]+(?:\s+[A-Z,\-]+)*)',
    # Look for LASTNAME,FIRSTNAME format specifically
    r'([A-Z\-]+,[A-Z\-]+)',
    # Look for name after license number in driving record section
    r'LICENCE NUMBER:\s*[A-Z0-9\-]+\s+EXPIRY DATE:\s*\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}\s+NAME:\s*([A-Z,\-]+(?:\s+[A-Z,\-]+)*)',
    # Fallback: Look for name in the summary table
    r'([A-Z\-]+,[A-Z\-]+)\s+\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}\s+\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}',
]
```

#### License Number Patterns
```python
license_patterns = [
    r'LICENCE NUMBER:\s*([A-Z0-9\-]+)',
    r'LICENSE NUMBER:\s*([A-Z0-9\-]+)',
    r'DLN:\s*([A-Z0-9\-]+)',
    r'DRIVER LICENSE:\s*([A-Z0-9\-]+)',
    r'LICENCE:\s*([A-Z0-9\-]+)',
    # More specific pattern for the format we see in the debug files
    r'ON\s+([A-Z0-9\-]+)\s+[A-Z,\-]+',  # Matches the table format
    # Fallback: Look for license number in the summary table at the end
    r'([A-Z]\d{4}-\d{5}-\d{5})',  # Format like T0168-58306-50618
]
```

### 2. Data Validation and Cleaning

#### Name Validation Function
```python
def is_likely_date(text):
    """
    Check if extracted text is likely a date rather than a name
    """
    text_upper = text.upper()
    
    # Check for day names
    day_names = ["SUNDAY", "MONDAY", "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "THURSDAY", "FRIDAY", "SATURDAY"]
    if any(day in text_upper for day in day_names):
        return True
    
    # Check for month names
    month_names = ["JANUARY", "FEBRUARY", "MARCH", "APRIL", "MAY", "JUNE", 
                   "JULY", "AUGUST", "SEPTEMBER", "OCTOBER", "NOVEMBER", "DECEMBER"]
    if any(month in text_upper for month in month_names):
        return True
    
    # Check for date patterns
    if re.search(r'\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{4}', text):
        return True
    
    # Check for time patterns
    if re.search(r'\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s*[AP]M', text):
        return True
    
    return False
```

#### Name Cleaning
```python
# Clean up the name by removing extra text
name = re.sub(r'\n.*$', '', name)  # Remove anything after newline
name = re.sub(r'\s+BIRTH\s+DATE.*$', '', name)  # Remove "BIRTH DATE" and following text
name = re.sub(r'\s+GENDER.*$', '', name)  # Remove "GENDER" and following text
name = re.sub(r'\s+HEIGHT.*$', '', name)  # Remove "HEIGHT" and following text
name = re.sub(r'\s+ADDRESS.*$', '', name)  # Remove "ADDRESS" and following text
name = name.strip()
```

### 3. Multi-Strategy Extraction

#### Robust Extraction Function
```python
def extract_mvr_data_robust(path):
    """
    Enhanced MVR extraction with multiple fallback strategies and better error handling
    """
    # Strategy 1: Try standard extraction
    # Strategy 2: Try alternative text extraction
    # Strategy 3: Try different PDF reading parameters
    # Validate and attempt to fix any issues
    # If still missing critical data, try fallback extraction
```

#### Fallback Extraction Strategies
```python
def extract_name_fallback(text, result):
    """
    Fallback name extraction using different strategies
    """
    # Strategy 1: Look for name in the driving record section
    # Strategy 2: Look for name in the summary table at the end
    # Strategy 3: Look for name after license number
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

#### Validation and Fixing
```python
def validate_and_fix_extracted_data(result, text, path):
    """
    Validate extracted data and attempt to fix common issues
    """
    # Check if name looks like a date (common extraction error)
    # Check if license number is reasonable
    # Check if we have essential fields
```

## Results Achieved
