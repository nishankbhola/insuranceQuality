## Testing

### Test Complete Data (Should PASS)
```bash
python test_automobile_validation.py
```

### Test Missing Data (Should FAIL)
```bash
python test_automobile_validation_fail.py
```

## Integration

The automobile validation is automatically included in the main QC evaluation:
```python
from qc_checklist import QCChecker

qc_checker = QCChecker()
results = qc_checker.evaluate_application_qc(application_data, quote_data)

# Filter automobile results
automobile_checks = [r for r in results if r["category"] == "Automobile Section"]
```

## Notes

- All vehicles in the application must have complete automobile information
- Partial information will result in FAIL status for missing fields
- The system supports multiple vehicles per application
- Field names are flexible (e.g., `purchase_price` or `list_price` both work)
- Boolean fields like `owned`/`leased` must be explicitly set to True/False
