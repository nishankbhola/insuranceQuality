Dear Navid,
Re: Application for Automobile Insurance 
 
COVERAGE NOT IN EFFECT
Further to our recent conversation, please find enclosed documentation to be signed, date and returned. 
BEFORE YOU SIGN THE APPLICATION AND THE OPTIONAL ACCIDENT BENEFITS CONFIRMATION 
FORM, please ensure that all the information is accurate as a false statement or misrepresentation can result in the 
cancellation of the policy by registered letter for non-disclosure and/or invalidate a claim. 
Please note that coverage IS NOT IN EFFECT until the following documentation is received in our office: 
1. Fully completed and signed application
2. Completed and signed Optional Accident Benefits Confirmation Form
3. Signed Monthly Authorization Form & VOID CHEQUE
4. Copy of vehicle(s) ownership – BOTH plate and permit portions of the ownership  
5. Signed Privacy Consent Form
6. Signed Personal Information Consent Form 
The above premium is subject to the Accident Benefits option(s) you have purchased.  Please contact our office should you 
wish to increase this coverage.
RIDE-SHARING SERVICE:  Coverage is EXCLUDED under the Standard Ontario Auto Policy when an automobile is 
used to carry paying passengers such as UBER or LYFT or used as a taxi.  This means that you may not have any coverage 
in the event of an accident, whether or not you are at fault in the accident.  If you are intending to participate in a ride-sharing 
service, as a driver, it is imperative that you contact our office to ensure you have proper insurance coverage that protects the 
driver, passengers and others
WARNING!  If an unlicensed, improperly licensed (this includes violation of the graduated licensing restrictions), or non-
disclosed driver operates your vehicle, your insurance may be cancelled by registered letter for non-disclosure and/or invalidate 
a claim. 
Please review your policy and report any changes in drivers, use, etc. to our office immediately.
HAS YOUR VEHICLE BEEN MODIFIED?  If so, you must notify us immediately as your policy may have to be 
amended.  Modifications to enhance speed are not acceptable and may null and void coverage.
If your vehicle (s) has non-factory installed electronic equipment that is worth more than $1,500.00, please contact our 
office to increase the coverage as the policy will currently only pay up to a maximum of $1,500.00.

Retain this document for your Records.
-
Some of the terms used in this application are explained further below. 
Insurer. You may also purchase additional insurance for Loss or Damage to the automobile and Optional
Increased Accident Benefits. This is a brief explanation of the insurance coverages available to you. For complete
details consult your policy. Your Insurer will supply you with a copy of the policy if you request it.

the limit of your coverage, and the cost of settling claims. 
OAF 1 
Page 1 of 6
Accident Benefits - Your insurance company is obligated to explain details of Accident Benefits coverage to you.
Provides benefits that you and other insured persons may be entitled to receive if injured or killed in an automobile
accident. These benefits include: income replacement for persons who have lost income; payments to non-
earners who suffer complete inability to carry on a normal life; payment of care expenses to persons who cannot
continue to act as a primary caregiver for a member of their household; payment of medical, rehabilitation and
attendant care expenses; payment of certain other expenses; payment of funeral expenses; and payments to
survivors of a person who is killed. You may also purchase optional benefits to increase the standard level of
benefits provided in your policy. 
The optional benefits your insurance company must offer are: 
Increased Income Replacement -The standard level of income replacement provided in the policy ($400
per week maximum) may be increased by purchasing optional coverage so that the weekly limit is up to $600,
$800 or $1,000. All income replacement benefits are based on 70% of your gross weekly income.
Increased Medical, Rehabilitation and Attendant Care - The standard benefit pays up to $65,000 for
medical, rehabilitation and attendant care expenses with a 5 year time limit in most cases. If catastrophically
impaired, the standard benefit pays up to $1,000,000 for medical, rehabilitation and attendant care expenses.
You may purchase an optional medical, rehabilitation and attendant care benefit of $130,000 or $1,000,000.
Additional Catastrophic Impairment - You may purchase an optional catastrophic impairment benefit of an
additional $1,000,000 added to the standard medical, rehabilitation and attendant care benefit or the optional
increased medical, rehabilitation and attendant care benefit.
Caregiver Benefit, Housekeeping and Home Maintenance Expenses - The standard benefit for caregiver
benefit, housekeeping and home maintenance expenses is available only for a person who is catastrophically
impaired. You may purchase an optional benefit to provide these coverages for other impairments. 
Death and Funeral - The standard level of death benefits paid to the surviving spouse and dependant of a
person who is killed ($25,000 to a surviving spouse and $10,000 to each surviving dependant) may be
doubled by purchasing this optional coverage. This coverage also increases the standard funeral expense
benefit from $6,000 to $8,000.
Dependant Care - There is no standard dependant care benefit. You may purchase an optional benefit to
receive weekly dependant care expenses of $75 for the first dependant, and $25 for each additional
dependant, up to $150 per week, for employed persons not receiving a weekly caregiver benefit.
Indexation Benefit -This optional coverage will ensure that certain weekly benefit payments and monetary
limits will be adjusted on an annual basis to reflect changes in the cost of living.
Uninsured Automobile
Provides coverage if you or other insured persons are injured or killed by an uninsured motorist or by an
unidentified (e.g. hit-and-run) driver. It also covers damage to your automobile and its contents caused by an
identified, uninsured motorist, subject to a $300 deductible.

Direct Compensation - Property Damage
Provides coverage in Ontario, under certain conditions, for damage to your automobile and to property it is
carrying, when another motorist is responsible. It is called Direct Compensation because you will collect from us,
your insurance company, even though you are not at fault for the accident. There may be a deductible amount,
and this amount is either paid by you toward the cost of repairs or is deducted from the loss settlement. Higher
deductibles may reduce your premium. You may elect not to recover damages from your insurance company
under this coverage if you make this election by providing written confirmation to your insurance company.
Loss or Damage 
Provides a selection of optional coverages for your own automobile. Payments cover direct and accidental loss of,
or damage to, a described automobile and its equipment. There is usually a deductible amount indicated for each
coverage and this amount is either paid by you toward the cost of repairs or is deducted from the loss settlement.
Higher deductibles may reduce your premium. There are four types of coverages:
Specified Perils: Covers the described automobile against loss or damage caused by certain specific perils.
They are: fire; theft or attempted theft; lightning, windstorm, hail or rising water; earthquake; explosion; riot or
civil disturbance; falling or forced landing of aircraft or parts of aircraft; or the stranding, sinking, burning,
derailment or collision of any kind of transport in, or upon which, the described automobile is being
transported.
Comprehensive: Covers a described automobile against loss or damage other than those covered by
Collision or Upset, including perils listed under Specified Perils, falling or flying objects, missiles and
vandalism.
Collision or Upset: Covers damage when a described automobile is involved in a collision with another
object or tips over. This coverage cannot be issued or offered to you if you have made an election not to
recover damages from us under Section 6, Direct Compensation - Property Damage Coverage.
All Perils: Combines the Collision or Upset and Comprehensive coverages. 
For purposes of the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), this document was issued in the course of the insurance
company’s insurance business in Canada.
